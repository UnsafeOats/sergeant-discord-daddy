### Discord bot for NIPRNet

it's a bot.  it does things.  was forked (well, cloned, because github doesn't want to let me fork my own repo) from a much older (and horribly structured) python discord bot i made for my group chat with the homies ([discord-librarian](https://github.com/UnsafeOats/discord-librarian)) many years ago.

### Current Structure

the bot currently retains two of it's appendages from it's previous (well, also still current, just in a different brain) life:

  1) archiver.py - functionality to allow easy archiving of paywalled urls
  2) creeper.py - just a fun module to listen to conversation and make random comments

the following new appendages have been added:

  1) roles.py - functionality to allow users to select their branch of service
